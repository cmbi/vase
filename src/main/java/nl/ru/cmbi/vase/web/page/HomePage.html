<p>
VASE is a web-tool for visualizing alignments on a protein structure.

It allows you to enter the ID of a protein structure in PDB format for which VASE
will generate an interface. VASE will show a set of homologous sequences, aligned
to the sequence of your structure, along with entropy/variability data and a
3D interface. Here's an example:
<a href="#" wicket:id="example-link" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" ><span wicket:id="example-id"></span></a>
</p>
<p>
VASE can work with official PDB entries, as well as custom structures.
To use your own structure, submit the contents of the PDB file in the
<a wicket:id="input-link" href="#">input page</a>
and wait for the job to finish. When the alignment is done, a link to it will appear.
